# Collaboration

- **Repository platform:** [Github](https://github.com/fabianfroding/cyber-car)
- **Organization platform:** [Trello](https://trello.com/b/V7dmJoN0/kanban-board) (KANBAN STYLE)
- **Communication platform:** Slack

**Practices:**

- Master branch should only have working code
- Dev branch should be reviewed before merging to master
- Pull requests (PR) into Dev branch must be reviewed by someone other than the person who made the PR

**Roles:**

1. Customer = Christian Berger
2. Product Owner = TA’s
3. Scrum Master = Salvatore
4. Vice Scrum Master = Fabian
5. Developers = Team

**Process:**

- We conduct sprints of 1 week length, starting with a sprint planning, which involves as participants the team members (including scrum master) and the product owner.
- Before the sprint planning the product backlog should be refined and the user stories re-organized according to their priority, and a plan should be prepared (ideas shall be brought to the meeting for discussion). The product backlog will list demonstrable User Stories to be reviewed at the Sprint Review.
- A team Retrospective will be conducted every final day of sprints for trying to improve the iterative process and analyze the obstacles we have faced. Time and place for it is decided in advance and every member will have a certain amount of time to talk freely without interruption.

**Meet-ups:**
All face to face meetings will take place in the Lindholmen area. As for the development of the product, we will be meeting face to face in Patricia. 
Nonetheless, there will be days where team members work individually from home and for such occasions, there will be video calls and tools (liveshare) that help users devlop collaboratively on vscode.

**Time allocated:**

1. Sprint planning: 1 hour
2. Sprint review: 30min
3. Sprint retrospective: 30min
4. Establish a DOD:
    - The user story is demonstrable and sufficiently tested.
    - The related documentation is complete
    - The code for that user story is committed and pushed according to the internal template.

# Communication in Group

**Daily stand-ups**
The daily sprints will take place on a dedicated slack channel where we discuss what we have done, if there are any problems we faced and what we intend to do next.
Since members of the team may not always be able to meet in person, having a daily stand up on a discord channel provides flexibility.

**Slack**
Slack will be the basis of our communication. We have dedicated channels for development, scheduling meetings, stand-up meetings and general converstaion regarding the vehicle.

# Conflict Resolution

- **Call when misunderstood:** When texting gets too complicated, the team members should discuss the issue over a call instead of text.
- **The bottle rule:** use a bottle (or some other object) to mitigate discussions in-person when too many people start talking at the same time.
- **2 vs 2:** Voting is going to be a part of decision-making and solution-proposing. In case of disagreement and 2 vs. 2 votes, decision will be made by Scrum Master
